# Character copy board
special typographical characters for quick use



#### Why
This was created for a personal purpose to quickly get access to special characters I'd like to use inside twitter.
Inspired from this very good article: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/10/space-yourself/ and taking use out of https://zenorocha.github.io/clipboard.js/ – it's very good! Build your onw!

#### Use
Want an alteration on a special <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23hash&amp;src=typd">#hash</a>​tag without cluttering the functionality or write about @​import without actually mentioning? Add zero-whitespace. Want to indicate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzxrzFCyOs">☛ a useful link</a>? Paste a pointing hand symbol. You got it.

#### Issues
Due to restrictions in Safari browser this will not work. You need to copy it by hand.
